Helen Huang's class, personal, and research projects.

# Personal Projects

## Cat Ninja iOS Game
Cat Ninja is an iOS game created in Swift using SwiftUI and SpriteKit. As a cat ninja, swipe cat toys and avoid water balloons. Score points and gain combos before the time runs out! [[Github]](https://github.com/helen-huang9/CatNinja)

*Artwork created by Helen Huang using Procreate.*

**Soon to be released on the App Store as* Samurai Cat

# Research
## NeRF Models
The following are some of the NeRF videos I helped produce during my research with Prof. Sridhar in the Brown Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab. 

These videos are 3D continuous scenes learned from a sparse set of images using a deep neural network. The object models and camera data was created and sampled in Blender.

# Course Projects
## Depth Capture System
I created a depth capture system as part of my CSCI 1430 Computer Vision final project with Kate Nelson, Angela Xing, and Lo McKeown. I developed an app that capture RGB images and its corresponding depth data, then visualize scene as a 3D voxel model. Implemented in Swift and Python. [[Github]](https://github.com/helen-huang9/Depth-Capture-System)

## OpenGL Underwater Scene
I created an underwater scene for my CSCI 1230 Computer Graphics final project with Kate Nelson and Angela Xing. We implemented randomly generated terrain, bezier curve camera movement, and L-system coral plants using C++ and OpenGL.
